It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful commandline pipelines.</p><p>Today, we&#39;re releasing a beta release of 0.60 of Nu.

You can now get much better errors, run code in parallel, run code generally faster, and more correctly.</p><p>We&#39;ll be talking about this more in the full release announcement, but we&#39;d also love your help in testing the engine as you port your code over to it.
