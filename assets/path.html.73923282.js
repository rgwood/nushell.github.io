* As a path literal, e.g., &#39;/home/viking/spam.txt&#39;
* As a structured path: a table with &#39;parent&#39;, &#39;stem&#39;, and &#39;extension&#39; (and
* &#39;prefix&#39; on Windows) columns. This format is produced by the &#39;path parse&#39;
  subcommand.
* As a list of path parts, e.g., &#39;[ / home viking spam.txt ]&#39;. Splitting into
  parts is done by the \`path split\` command.

All subcommands accept all three variants as an input. Furthermore, the &#39;path
join&#39; subcommand can be used to join the structured path or path parts back into
the path literal.
