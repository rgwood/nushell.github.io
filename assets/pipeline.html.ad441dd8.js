Just as Nu extends from the single string data type of Unix, Nu also extends the idea of the pipeline to include more than just text.</p><h2 id="basics" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#basics" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Basics</h2><p>A pipeline is composed of three parts: the input, the filter, and the output.</p><div class="language-text ext-text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; open &quot;Cargo.toml&quot; | inc package.version | save &quot;Cargo_new.toml&quot;
</code></pre></div><p>The first command, <code>open &quot;Cargo.toml&quot;</code>, is an input (sometimes also called a &quot;source&quot; or &quot;producer&quot;). This creates or loads data and feeds it into a pipeline. It&#39;s from input that pipelines have values to work with. Commands like <code>ls</code> are also inputs, as they take data from the filesystem and send it through the pipelines so that it can be used.</p><p>The second command, <code>inc package.version</code>, is a filter. Filters take the data they are given and often do something with it. They may change it (as with the <code>inc</code> command in our example), or they may do another operation, like logging, as the values pass through.</p><p>The last command, <code>save &quot;Cargo_new.toml&quot;</code>, is an output (sometimes called a &quot;sink&quot;). An output takes input from the pipeline and does some final operation on it. In our example, we save what comes through the pipeline to a file as the final step. Other types of output commands may take the values and view them for the user.</p><h2 id="multi-line-pipelines" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#multi-line-pipelines" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Multi-line pipelines</h2><p>If a pipeline is getting a bit long for one line, you can enclose it within <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> to create a subexpression:</p><div class="language-text ext-text"><pre class="language-text"><code>(
    &quot;01/22/2021&quot; |
    parse &quot;{month}/{day}/{year}&quot; |
    get year
)

Let's look at some examples of working with external commands:"),b=n(`<p><code>internal_command | external_command</code></p><p>Data will flow from the internal_command to the external_command. This data is expected to be strings, so that they can be sent to the <code>stdin</code> of the external_command.</p><p><code>external_command | internal_command</code></p><p>Data coming from an external command into Nu will collect into a single string, and then will be passed into internal_command. Commands like <code>lines</code> help make it easier to bring in data from external commands in such a way that it&#39;s easier to work with.</p><p><code>external_command_1 | external_command_2</code></p><p>Nu works with data piped between two external commands in the same way as other shells, like Bash would. The <code>stdout</code> of external_command_1 is connected to the <code>stdin</code> of external_command_2. This lets data flow naturally between the two commands.</p><h2 id="behind-the-scenes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#behind-the-scenes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Behind the scenes</h2><p>You may have wondered how we see a table if <code>ls</code> is an input and not an output. Nu adds this output for us automatically using another command called <code>autoview</code>. The <code>autoview</code> command is appended to any pipeline that doesn&#39;t have an output allowing us to see the result.</p><p>In effect, the command:</p><div class="language-text ext-text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; ls
</code></pre></div><p>And the pipeline:</p><div class="language-text ext-text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; ls | autoview
