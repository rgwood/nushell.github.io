Just as Nu extends from the single string data type of Unix, Nu also extends the idea of the pipeline to include more than just text.</p><h2 id="basics" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#basics" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Basics</h2><p>A pipeline is composed of three parts: the input, the filter, and the output.</p><div class="language-text ext-text"><pre class="language-text"><code>&gt; open &quot;Cargo.toml&quot; | inc package.version --minor | save &quot;Cargo_new.toml&quot;

This creates or loads data and feeds it into a pipeline. It's from input that pipelines have values to work with. Commands like `),f=e("code",null,"ls",-1),g=t(" are also inputs, as they take data from the filesystem and send it through the pipelines so that it can be used."),x=t("The second command, "),w=e("code",null,"inc package.version --minor",-1),b=t(", is a filter.

An output takes input from the pipeline and does some final operation on it. In our example, we save what comes through the pipeline to a file as the final step. Other types of output commands may take the values and view them for the user.</p><p>The <code>$in</code> variable will collect the pipeline into a value for you, allowing you to access the whole stream as a parameter:</p><div class="language-nushell ext-nushell"><pre class="language-nushell"><code>&gt; [1 2 3] | $in.1 * $in.2
